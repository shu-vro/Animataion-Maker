🚀 **Turning Drawings into Animations – Meet Animation Maker!** 🎨✨

Ever wished you could just **draw** an animation instead of coding it from scratch? Well, that’s exactly what **Animation Maker** does! 🎭🖌️

This little **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** project captures your strokes on a **canvas** and magically converts them into **CSS animations**—no tedious keyframing required! Just **draw, generate, and animate.** 🚀

🔥 **Why I Built This?**  
This is my **second project** after diving into the **Canvas API**, and honestly, seeing drawings come to life was super satisfying! 🤩 It started as a simple experiment, but watching raw strokes transform into smooth animations? That feeling is just _chef’s kiss_ 👌✨

💡 **What You Can Do With It?**  
✅ **Sketch** animations dynamically  
✅ **Generate & export** CSS keyframes  
✅ **Adapt & customize** for creative projects

It’s fun, it’s lightweight, and it’s totally open for your wild ideas! Check out the **codebase**, tinker around, and let me know what you think. Would love to hear what kind of animations you’d create with it! 🚀🎨
